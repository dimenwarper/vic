Assessment of variant information content (VIC) requires one input file with the following format

-----Example input file for vic_analysis.py (note: the file is tab-delimited)-----

# Comments are ignored
# First line will be the header

Chromosome	Start	End	Name of region(e.g. gene)	Feature1	Feature2:float	...
chr14		1232	1234	ACTN2				intronic	0.4
(or simply 14)


---------


The first 4 columns are obligatory, the rest is optional (although you will of course want to
have at least one feature). Each feature is treated as a categorical variable unless otherwise
specified (:type, types include str, int, and float). 


-----Example output files for vic_analysis.py----
-----Feature profile file-----
ACTN2	intronic,0.5:0.5 intronic,0.3:0.3 exonic,0.3:0.2
...
-----variant information content file----
chr14		1232	1234	ACTN2	3.45
....
-----


The feature profile file describes frequencies for feature combinations in the format feature1,feature2,...:frequence feature1,feature2....:frequency... (notice the spaces separating each combination)
The variant information content file has each chromosome coordinate and region plus their vic score.
